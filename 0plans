BlackJack Rules:
Ace is worth 1 or 11
Face cards are worth 10
Before the deal each player places a bet
Minimums are established before the game
*We are doing 52 game, no card splitting*
*Due to this we are dealing cards face down*
Dealer gives all players 1 cards face up including himself and then another card facedown to himself and faceup for the rest
Natural = BLACKJACK!!
if Dealer has a natural he collects bets of all players without naturals
if Dealer and some player have naturals the player keeps their bet
If Player has natural and dealer does not he collects 1.5x their bet
The Play
Player on the left starts, asks for a hit (add another card) or to stand(stay with their cards)
that players turn ends when they bust or stand
treat the player to their left the same
any player can choose an ace to be 1 or 11 whenever applicable, called a "soft hand"
Dealer then flips his second card, if greater than 16 the dealer stands, if less the dealer hits
if dealer has an ace and it will make the sum greater than 16 he must count it as 11
If your starting hand is two of the same kind you can split it by placing double the bet, 1 on each card, and playing them as seperate cards
if you split two aces you can only hit once and the payoff is x1 as opposed to 1.5 in any other situation
if sum of 2 cards is 9-11 you can double down by doubling your bet and taking just one card face down and is turned at the ends
Dealer may not split or double down 
if dealers face up card is an ace players can have an insurance of up to half their original bet and if the face down card is a 10 they win twice their half bet
*HOUSE RULES: WE RESHUFFLE WHEN 15 CARDS ARE LEFT IN THE DECK*
